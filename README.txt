ntermd is a pure javascript terminal run on node.js. 
It used web socket instead of ajax so server can push screen updates to client.
It was inspired by Ajaxterm(http://antony.lesuisse.org/qweb/trac/wiki/AjaxTerm),
Webshell(http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mressl/webshell),
last but not least Term::VT102(http://search.cpan.org/~ajwood/Term-VT102-0.91/VT102.pm)
For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.
